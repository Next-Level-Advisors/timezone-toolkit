# Code Evaluation & Deployment Solutions

## Purpose
This document logs potential problems and solutions encountered during Cloud Run deployment preparation. It serves as a reference for future development and troubleshooting.

## Cloud Run Deployment Preparation

### Challenge 1: Container Health Checks
**Problem**: Cloud Run requires reliable health checks for proper service management and load balancing.

**Solutions Attempted**: 
1. ‚úÖ **Final Solution**: Added dedicated `/health` endpoint returning structured JSON with service status, timestamp, uptime, and service identifier.

**Implementation**:
```javascript
app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({ 
    status: 'healthy',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    service: 'TimezoneToolkit API'
  });
});
```

### Challenge 2: Graceful Shutdown Handling
**Problem**: Cloud Run sends SIGTERM signals during scaling down or deployments. Applications need to handle these gracefully to avoid dropped requests.

**Solutions Attempted**:
1. ‚úÖ **Final Solution**: Implemented proper signal handling for SIGTERM and SIGINT with graceful server closure.

**Implementation**:
```javascript
const gracefulShutdown = (signal) => {
  console.log(`Received ${signal}. Starting graceful shutdown...`);
  server.close(() => {
    console.log('Server closed. Exiting process.');
    process.exit(0);
  });
};

process.on('SIGTERM', () => gracefulShutdown('SIGTERM'));
process.on('SIGINT', () => gracefulShutdown('SIGINT'));
```

### Challenge 3: Docker Build Optimization
**Problem**: Large container images increase cold start times and deployment duration.

**Solutions Attempted**:
1. ‚úÖ **Final Solution**: Multi-stage Docker build separating build dependencies from runtime, using Alpine Linux for smaller base image, and comprehensive .dockerignore.

**Key Optimizations**:
- Multi-stage build (builder + production stages)
- Alpine Linux base (node:18-alpine)
- Production-only dependencies in final image
- Excluded source maps and development files via .dockerignore
- Non-root user for security

### Challenge 4: Port Configuration
**Problem**: Cloud Run dynamically assigns ports via PORT environment variable.

**Solutions Attempted**:
1. ‚úÖ **Final Solution**: Server already properly configured with `process.env.PORT || 3000` and updated to bind to '0.0.0.0' for container compatibility.

## Potential Future Issues

### Issue: Rate Limiting in Production
**Concern**: Current rate limit (100 requests/15 min) may be too restrictive for production use.
**Solution Implemented**: Custom rate limiting with domain exemptions:
- **Unlimited**: nldrive.ai and nladv.com domains (no rate limits)
- **Standard**: All other requests (100 requests/15 minutes)
**Monitoring**: Watch Cloud Run metrics for 429 responses
**Implementation**: Checks Origin, Referer, and Host headers for domain identification

### Issue: Cold Starts
**Concern**: Container cold starts may cause initial request delays
**Monitoring**: Cloud Run startup time metrics
**Solution**: Consider minimum instances or warming strategies if needed

### Issue: Memory/CPU Limits
**Concern**: Default Cloud Run limits may be insufficient for high load
**Monitoring**: Watch resource utilization metrics
**Solution**: Adjust Cloud Run service configuration as needed

### Challenge 5: Docker Build - TypeScript Compilation Issues
**Problem 1**: Docker build failing with "tsc: not found" error during npm ci --only=production in builder stage.
- **Root Cause**: TypeScript compiler is a dev dependency but builder stage was only installing production dependencies.
- **Solution**: Install all dependencies (including dev dependencies) in builder stage.

**Problem 2**: Docker build failing with "No inputs were found in config file" TypeScript error.
- **Root Cause**: The `prepare` script in package.json runs `npm run build` during `npm ci`, but source files weren't copied yet.
- **Solution**: Copy source files BEFORE running `npm ci` so the prepare script can find them.

**Final Implementation**:
```dockerfile
# Copy package files and source code first
COPY package*.json ./
COPY tsconfig.json ./
COPY src/ ./src/

# Install dependencies (prepare script builds automatically)
RUN npm ci
```

## Status
‚úÖ **Ready for Deployment**: All critical deployment challenges addressed (including build issues)
üîç **Monitoring Required**: Production metrics will inform any needed optimizations
