# Code Evaluation Log

## 1. Docker Multi-Stage Build Issues (SOLVED)

**Problem**: Cloud Build failing with TypeScript compilation errors in multi-stage Docker builds.

**Attempts**:
1. First attempt: `npm ci --only=production` in builder stage - failed because `tsc` not available
2. Second attempt: Changed to `npm ci` but source files not copied yet
3. Third attempt: Reordered COPY operations but `prepare` script ran twice

**Final Solution**: 
- Builder stage: `npm ci` (all deps) + copy source files first
- Production stage: `npm ci --only=production --ignore-scripts` + explicit copy of built files
- This prevents the `prepare` script from running twice and failing

## 2. Express Rate Limiting in Cloud Run (SOLVED)

**Problem**: `ValidationError: The 'X-Forwarded-For' header is set but the Express 'trust proxy' setting is false`

**Solution**: Added `app.set('trust proxy', true);` to properly handle Cloud Run proxy headers.

## 3. DateTime Parsing Enhancement (SOLVED)

**Problem**: API not parsing `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS` format (used by HighLevel/Drive appointments).

**Solution**: Enhanced `parseTime` function in `dateTimeUtils.ts` to support multiple common formats including the required Drive format.

## 4. N8N Code Node HTTP Requests (COMPLEX - SOLVED)

**Problem**: Making HTTP requests from N8N Code Nodes proved challenging with multiple API approaches failing.

**Attempts**:
1. Standard `fetch()` API - Failed silently in N8N environment
2. N8N's `$http.request` helper - Unreliable, inconsistent results
3. N8N's `this.helpers.httpRequest` - Correct approach but syntax errors with top-level `await`

**Solutions Applied**:
1. **Syntax Issue**: Wrapped entire script in async IIFE: `return (async () => { ... })();`
2. **HTTP Method**: Used `this.helpers.httpRequest` with `uri` (not `url`) parameter
3. **Architecture Decision**: Split into separate scripts for better separation of concerns

**Final Architecture**:
- **Script 1** (`n8n-calendar-parser-only.js`): Parse calendar data, extract user IDs
- **Loop Node**: Iterate through user IDs
- **HTTP Request Node**: Call HighLevel API for each user
- **Script 2** (`n8n-calendar-combiner.js`): Combine user data with calendar options

**Key Learnings**:
- N8N Code Nodes have limitations with certain JavaScript APIs
- `this.helpers.httpRequest` is the correct method, but requires proper async handling
- Separation of concerns (parsing vs. HTTP requests) creates more reliable workflows
- Sequential processing with dedicated HTTP nodes is more stable than complex Code Node requests

## 5. Data Structure Mapping (SOLVED)

**Problem**: Complex nested data structures from HighLevel Calendar API needed to be mapped to user-friendly format for AI agents.

**Solution**: Created comprehensive data transformation that:
- Maps meeting types to natural language descriptions
- Handles priority sorting and primary user designation
- Creates both structured data and natural language text for AI consumption
- Provides fallback handling for missing user data

**Result**: Clean, readable booking options that AI agents can easily understand and present to users.

## Future Considerations

1. **Rate Limiting**: HighLevel API has rate limits - the sequential processing with Loop Node naturally handles this
2. **Error Handling**: Each component handles errors independently, making debugging easier
3. **Scalability**: Architecture supports easy extension for additional calendar features
4. **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns makes individual components easier to update
