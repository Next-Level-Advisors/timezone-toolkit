# data-flow-diagrams

Primary Data Flow Paths:

1. Timezone Service Integration
- Input: Raw timezone identifiers and timestamps
- Output: Formatted business time representations
- Flow: timezoneConversion.ts → workingHours.ts → meetingScheduler.ts
Importance Score: 85/100

2. Holiday Management Pipeline
- Input: Regional holiday definitions, calendar systems
- Output: Validated holiday periods affecting scheduling
- Flow: holidayAwareness.ts → workingHours.ts → meetingScheduler.ts
Importance Score: 80/100

3. Meeting Scheduler Orchestration
- Input: Participant availability, timezone data, holiday constraints
- Output: Optimized meeting slots with business rule compliance
- Flow: meetingScheduler.ts ← [timezoneConversion.ts, holidayAwareness.ts, workingHours.ts]
Importance Score: 90/100

4. Astronomical Data Integration
- Input: Geographic coordinates, date parameters
- Output: Business-specific daylight period calculations
- Flow: sunriseSunset.ts → workingHours.ts → meetingScheduler.ts
Importance Score: 75/100

Key Integration Points:

1. Working Hours Calculation Hub
- Aggregates timezone, holiday, and astronomical data
- Produces consolidated business hours validation
- Central coordination point for all scheduling constraints

2. Meeting Scheduler Engine
- Final integration point for all data flows
- Combines constraints into actionable scheduling decisions
- Implements business rule enforcement for meeting arrangements

Domain-Specific Data Transformations:
- Holiday pattern recognition to scheduling constraints
- Timezone differences to working hours overlap windows
- Astronomical calculations to business operation periods
- Regional preferences to meeting slot scoring
