# scheduling-engine-logic

The meeting scheduler engine implements sophisticated business logic for coordinating meetings across global teams, considering multiple timezones, holidays, and participant preferences.

Core Components:

1. Meeting Slot Optimization (src/services/meetingScheduler.ts)
- Scoring system evaluates potential meeting slots based on:
  - Participant availability overlap
  - Working hours compatibility
  - Holiday conflicts
  - Timezone spread optimization
Importance Score: 95/100

2. Working Hours Management (src/services/workingHours.ts)
- Calculates optimal meeting windows across participant timezones
- Enforces regional business hours compliance
- Handles daylight savings transitions
Importance Score: 85/100

3. Holiday Integration (src/services/holidayAwareness.ts)
- Multi-calendar system support for regional holidays
- Recurring holiday pattern recognition
- Cross-region holiday conflict resolution
Importance Score: 80/100

4. Timezone Coordination (src/services/timezoneConversion.ts)
- Business-specific timezone conversion rules
- International date line handling
- Regional time format standardization
Importance Score: 75/100

Key Business Rules:
1. Meeting Slot Selection
- Prioritize slots with maximum participant availability
- Respect local working hours for all participants
- Avoid recognized holidays in participant regions
- Minimize timezone spread between participants

2. Availability Calculation
- Consider recurring calendar patterns
- Account for holiday blackout periods
- Apply regional working hours restrictions
- Handle timezone-specific edge cases

3. Scoring System
- Higher weights for mandatory participant availability
- Penalties for meetings outside standard hours
- Bonuses for optimal timezone spreads
- Adjustments for recurring meeting patterns
